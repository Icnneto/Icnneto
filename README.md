<h2>Professional Goals</h2>
<p1>
  As with every journey, it all starts with the first steps! At the moment, I'm focusing on front-end development, learning the basic applications of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!<br>
  In the long term, I intend to transition to the Back-end area, with the primary objective of <strong>becoming a Full-stack</strong> developer<br>
