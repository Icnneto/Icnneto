# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Israel Nunes

I'm a software development student based in Florianópolis, Brazil, currently studying Full-Stack Development at **FIAP**. With a background in **Public Administration** from **UDESC**, I bring a mix of analytical thinking and user-centered perspective to the tech world.

Currently, I focus on building clean and purposeful web applications. You’ll find in this profile my journey from learning fundamentals to creating real-world solutions.

## Tech Stack

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript  
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, SQL  
- **AI & Automation**: Puppeteer (stealth), LLM integration, Scrapy  
- **Other Tools**: Git & GitHub, Postman, Firebase, Render, Vercel

I'm also exploring how to use **LLMs and AI-powered tools** to process unstructured data and provide useful insights in projects like newsletters, dashboards, and RAG systems.

## Featured Projects

## 📌 About Me

- Currently studying at **FIAP** and transitioning into tech with a purpose: build tools that simplify processes and empower people.
- I lived in **Dublin, Ireland** for 8 months and traveled to 9 countries and over 20 cities—cultural exposure that expanded how I solve problems and communicate.
- I have a deep connection with the ocean (living on an island with 42+ beaches helps) and surfing is one of my greatest passions.
- I love learning—tech-related or not—and enjoy sharing knowledge and collaborating on new ideas.
